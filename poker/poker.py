"""
This module provides functions for comparing seven card
poker hands and holdem hands.  Note that several lookup
tables are immediately build on import to increase performance
by eliminating the dot notation of classes.

It includes a 30 MB lookup table which allows approximately
a 4 times speed increase for holdem2p() over poker_lite.holdem2p().

The hash scheme for the lookup table was inspired by the specialK hand
evaluator blog:
http://specialk-coding.blogspot.com/2010/04/texas-holdem-7-card-evaluator_23.html
The table is populated by the poker_lite.handvalue function.
